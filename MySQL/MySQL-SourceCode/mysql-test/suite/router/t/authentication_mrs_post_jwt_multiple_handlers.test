# Verify authentication support per service where user session is identified
# by JWT token using POST data authentication where credentials
# are not exchanged directly, but using a secure SCRAM-SHA256 flow.
#
# The test assigns "authentication application", to a service and
# checks if default permissions allow to access all object under
# the service that require authentication.
# Additionally there are two authentication apps in one of the
# services. This makes that there is no default authentication
# app for it, in other words the client-application must
# specify which app should be used.
