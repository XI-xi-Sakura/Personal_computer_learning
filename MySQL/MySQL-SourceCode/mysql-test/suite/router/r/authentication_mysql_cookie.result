## I. Create two servcices that have basic-mysql authentication:
#
# 1. under first service create a schema that requires authentication
#    and create two objects that doesn't require authenticatin, still
#    they inherits authentication requirement from schema.
# 2. under second service create a schema that doest require authentication
#    and create two objects that one requires authentication.
#       srv1(basic auth)->schema1(requires-auth)->object1(doesn't require)
#       srv1(basic auth)->schema1(requires-auth)->object2(doesn't require)
#       srv2(basic auth)->schema2(doesn't require)->object3(requires)
#       srv2(basic auth)->schema2(doesn't require)->object4(doesn't require)
# 3. create service with configured validation of onCompleteRedirection pattern
#
## II. Verify that non authorized request
#
# 1. Have access to db-object (/srv2/schema2/object4)
# 2. Doesn't have access to db-object (object1,object2,object3)
#
## III. Authenticate user1 against service: /srv1, and verify it
#
# 1. Have access to db-object (object1,object2,object4)
# 2. Doesn't have access to db-object (object3)
#
## IV. Authenticate user2 against service: /srv2, and verify it
#
# 1. Have access to db-object (object3,object4)
# 2. Doesn't have access to db-object (object1,object2)
#
## V. Authenticate using
#
# 1. svc_local and empty redirection (unauthorized)
# 2. svc_local and non matching redirection (unauthorized)
# 3. svc_bad and any redirection (unauthorized)
# 4. svc_aaa and any "aaa!" redirection (unauthorized)
# 5. svc_local and matching redirection (ok)
