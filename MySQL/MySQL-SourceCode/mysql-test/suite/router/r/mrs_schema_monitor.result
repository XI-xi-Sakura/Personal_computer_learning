# MySQL Rest Service schema created.
# MySQL Rest Service, server accounts configured.

I. Verify that the monitoring thread adds the router entry when it is missing in the metadata

DELETE from mysql_rest_service_metadata.router where id = 1;
SELECT id from mysql_rest_service_metadata.router where id = 1;
id
1

II. Verify that when the monitoring thread sees incompatible metadata version it stops the service and restores it when it becomes compatible again.

DROP view `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`msm_schema_version`;
CREATE ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` SQL SECURITY INVOKER
VIEW `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`msm_schema_version`(`major`,`minor`,`patch`)
AS select 1 AS `1`,0 AS `0`,0 AS `0`;
DROP view `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`msm_schema_version`;
CREATE ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` SQL SECURITY INVOKER
VIEW `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`msm_schema_version`(`major`,`minor`,`patch`)
AS select 4 AS `4`,0 AS `0`,0 AS `0`;

III. Verify that when the service_enabled flag is cleared in the metadata the mtr stops the service and restores it when it becomes enabled again.

update `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`config` set service_enabled = 0;
update `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`config` set service_enabled = 1;

IV. Verify that when the monitoring thread encounters invalid metadata (missing view) it stops the service and restores once it becomes available again

DROP view `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`msm_schema_version`;
CREATE ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` SQL SECURITY INVOKER
VIEW `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`msm_schema_version`(`major`,`minor`,`patch`)
AS select 4 AS `4`,0 AS `0`,0 AS `0`;

V. Verify that when there is a discrepancy in the audit_log table (index) the MRS still notices the changes in the metadata by doing a full refresh

# Registred DB_OBJECT at path: /svc/basic_schema/tab3
delete from `mysql_rest_service_metadata`.`audit_log`;
DROP SCHEMA basic_schema;
DROP SCHEMA mysql_rest_service_metadata;
DROP ROLE mysql_rest_service_admin;
DROP ROLE mysql_rest_service_schema_admin;
DROP ROLE mysql_rest_service_meta_provider;
DROP ROLE mysql_rest_service_data_provider;
DROP ROLE mysql_rest_service_dev;
