# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Tests that an autocommitted XA transaction where the master crashes
# just before writing the XID log event is executed correctly.  The
# master rolls back, so the slave should not execute statement.
#
# This test was previously part of rpl_ndb_transaction.test
#
#
# ==== Method ====
#
# We want master to be alive so that it can replicate the statement to
# the slave. So in the test case, we must not crash the
# master. Instead, we fake the crash by just not writing the XID event
# to the binlog. This is done by the @@debug='d,do_not_write_xid'
# flag. This, in turn, requires us to do 'source
# include/have_debug.inc'
#
# So, unlike if the master had crashed, the master *will* execute the
# statement. But the slave should not execute it. Hence, after the
# test is executed, the expected result on master is a table with one
# row, and on slave a table with no rows.
#
# To simulate the slave correctly, we wait until everything up to but
# not including the XID is replicated. This has to be done with
# include/rpl/sync_to_replica_received.inc, not sync_slave_with_master,
# since the latter waits until the slave *SQL* thread has caught up
# with the master's position, which it will never do.
#
