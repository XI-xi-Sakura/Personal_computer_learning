Enabling MRS Script Support
===========================

The MySQL Rest Service has the capacity to expose MRS Scripts written in
TypeScript through REST end points. The support for MRS Scripts is enabled by
adding the native Polyglot API library (From GraalVM) dependency.

To enable the functionality provide the following argument to the CMake call
when configuring the project:

    -DMRS_JIT_EXECUTOR_LIB=<Path>

Path is expected to contain the native Polyglot Native API Library and header
files. To build The native Polyglot API library follow the instructions at
ext/polyglot/README.txt

Note that version 23.0.1 is needed and newer versions may not work.
