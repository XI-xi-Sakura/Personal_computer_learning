/**
 * Registry of graal contexts to be used by each service.
 *
 * NOTE: The original idea, was to have a pool of contexts on which the service
 * module files would be loaded once and then shared across the contexts in the
 * pool. The script end points would be getting a context from the pool use it
 * and the release it. However, the main pre-requisite for that is that the
 * context could be reset to the original state, which is NOT possible in Graal.
 *
 * Suggestion from the Graal Team
 *
 * By default, each context would internally create an engine which would hold
 * the resources used in the context. However, it is possible to use a common
 * engine to enable the sharing of the resources  across contexts (i.e.
 * including parsed source code). Following this approach the context pool is
 * not needed since we would simply create/release the context on demand and it
 * would use the shared resources from the engine.
 *
 * Even this is the current implementation, expectation was that the module
 * files would be loaded only ONCE but that's not the case, they get reloaded on
 * every created context, even the shared engine is used.
 *
 * This class holds a registry of service ids vs ContextHandlers (who keep the
 * shared engine) and allows creating a context using the shared engine.
